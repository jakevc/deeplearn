## Deeplearn 

This repository documents my progress using deep learning techniques. The work is mostly inspired by the course, ["Practical Deep Learning for Coders"](https://course.fast.ai/). For that reason I will primarily be using jupyter notebooks, and the fastai library which is basically a python API to implement state of the art deep learning models, relying heavily on the [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) library.
