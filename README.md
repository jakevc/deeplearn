## Deeplearn 

This repository documents my progress using deep learning techniques. The work is inspired by the course, [Practical Deep Learning for Coders](https://course.fast.ai/). For that reason I will primarily be using jupyter notebooks, and the fastai library, a Python API to implement state of the art deep learning models, relying heavily on the deep learning library [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/).

## Notebooks

    - [BirdClassifier.ipynb](https://github.com/jakevc/deeplearn/blob/master/BirdClassifier.ipynb) uses fastai to train a computer vision model using transfer learning. The model is trained to recognize birds from a carefully curated set of 42,562 bird images, NABirds V1 described in the publication: [Van Horn et al. 2015](https://vision.cornell.edu/se3/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Horn_Building_a_Bird_2015_CVPR_paper.pdf).
